# Multi-Level Self-Resonant Modeling Theory

## Definition
A self-resonant modeling system is defined as a construct in which multiple layers interact through internal feedback loops. Each layer is capable of detecting resonance patterns within itself and across adjacent layers, triggering adaptation and structural reconfiguration.

## Application
This theory applies to the design of adaptive AI agents, dynamic system controllers, and cognitive feedback models. It ensures high resilience, real-time adaptability, and robust performance under complex environments.

## Constructive Framework
Let L_i represent each layer in the model. The resonance function R(L_i, L_{i±1}) determines the influence propagation. If the resonance threshold is exceeded, reconfiguration logic φ(L_i) is activated.

## Summary
The multi-level self-resonant modeling theory formalizes a foundational principle for autonomous system behavior tuning, leveraging hierarchical interaction for learning and adaptation.
